# HungrySquirrel
## *Feeeeeeed meeeeee* üêøÔ∏è

This is a game where you need to be the BSOC (Big Squirrel on Campus) and eat all of the other squirrels that are smaller than you while avoiding getting eaten so you can be the OMEGA SQUIRREL.

Most of the `hungrysquirrel.py` code is from Al Sweigart's amazing book [Making Games with Python & Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/); I adjusted the `main()` function to enable it to play some of my [original music](https://soundcloud.com/beeankha/tracks).

### Running the Game

I haven't packaged this game so you'll need to clone this repository locally (make sure you have Python3 and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) installed) and run the following:

```
$ python -m hungry_squirrel
```
